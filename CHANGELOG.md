# Deluge Community Firmware Change Log

> To find a detailed list of how to use each feature, check here: [Community Features](docs/community_features.md)

## c1.3.0

### Sound Engine
- Added a Warbler fx and a warble LFO to synths/kits/kit rows/song/audio clips
- Added a boss/roland style Dimension effect
- Made grain much faster and updated controls
- Added LPF to Mutable Instruments Reverb
- Added two more envelopes (Envelope 3 and Envelope 4), which you can access from the sound editor menu.
- Added two more LFOs (LFO 3 -global- and LFO 4 -per voice-), which you can access from the sound editor menu.

#### <ins>Per-clip Stutter with options: Quantize, Reverse, and Ping-Pong</ins>
- Now the stutter buffer can also be set to play in reverse, and ping-pong.
- A new menu has been added to the `SONG` menu, under `FX` submenu, to set the stutter configuration for the song.
- An extra menu has been added per sound source (either synths, kit rows, affect-entire kits, or audio clips) to
set the stutter configuration independently of the song configuration if you wish.

### User Interface

#### <ins>Accessibility</ins>
- Added `DEFAULTS (DEFA) > UI > ACCESSIBILITY (ACCE)` menu which contains accessibility changes to the Deluge UI to make the deluge more accessible to users with disabilities. These changes include:
  - `Shortcuts (SHOR)` to make specific shortcut combinations more accessible for users with mobility restrictions.
    - `HORIZONTAL ENCODER ◀︎▶︎` + `PLAY` is changed to `CROSS SCREEN` + `PLAY`
  - `Menu Highlighting (HIGH)` changes how menu highlighting is rendered on `OLED` displays by drawing a vertical bar `|` on the left edge of the display beside the selected menu item instead of highlighting the area of the selected menu item by inverting the text.

#### <ins>Horizontal Menus</ins>
- The menus for the following items have been updated on OLED, with multiple values visible and editable at the same time. Hold `SHIFT` and turn `SELECT` to edit them. This feature is on by default, and can be disabled via `SETTINGS > COMMUNITY FEATURES`.
  - Envelope 1 & 2.
  - LPF and HPF.
  - LFOs.

#### <ins>Clip Name Display & Copying</ins>
- If a clip has no named "SECTION N" is displayed in place of the clip name, indicating which section the clip is in.
- If a clip has a name, it is displayed with a number prefix, indicating its section, eg. "3: CHORUS".
- When clips are copied, the clip name is copied as well. If the target track already has a clip with the same name, an integer suffix starting from 2 is added unless the name already has an integer suffix. This integer suffix is incremented until the clip name is unique on the target track. Ie. copying a clip named "BRIDGE" to the same otherwise empty track will first create "BRIDGE2", then "BRIDGE3", etc.

#### <ins>Tempo</ins>
- Added Community Feature toggle (`Settings > Community Features > Alternative Tap Tempo Behaviour (TAPT)`) to adjust number of `TAP TEMPO` button presses to engage `TAP TEMPO` to `FOUR (4)` to avoid mistakingly changing tempo.

#### <ins>Recording</ins>
- Added `THRESHOLD RECORDING` default setting which can be turned on in the `SETTINGS > RECORDING > THRESHOLD RECORDING (THRE) > MODE` submenu
  - When this is enabled, recording of external audio input (e.g. Line In / Microphone) will only begin when it detects an audio signal according the Recording Threshold mode that has been set. There are four Threshold Recording modes that can be selected from:
    - `DISABLED (OFF)`: Standard Deluge behaviour. Recording starts right away.
    - `LOW`: Sets a lower threshold for lower input signals.
    - `MEDIUM`: Sets a medium threshold that is good for most signals (including the internal microphone with gain off).
    - `HIGH`: Sets a high threshold that is good for noisy signals / microphones with gain
  - You can also view and temporarily change the current threshold recording setting as follows:
    - Press and hold `RECORD` + turn  `SELECT`
    - Enter the Song menu while in Song or Arranger View by pressing `SELECT` and entering the `SONG > THRESHOLD RECORDING (THRE) > MODE` submenu

#### <ins>Audio Export</ins>
- Added `EXPORT MIXDOWN` configuration option which provides the ability to export all unmuted tracks in Arranger View as a single stereo file. This is disabled by default but can be enabled in the export configuration menu located at: `SONG\EXPORT AUDIO\CONFIGURE EXPORT\EXPORT MIXDOWN`

#### <ins>Save/Load Patterns</ins>
- Added ability to save / load Pattern-Files to Files. A Pattern represents all Notes of the actual Deluge Screen including Velocity, Probability, Lift, Iterance and Fill. The Patterns can be either of Type melodic Instrument (Synt, Midi, CV) or rhythmic Instrument (Kit, Drum). It's also possible to convert Midi-Files to patterns, which can then be used on the Deluge. See documentation at [Save / Load Patterns feature ](docs/features/save_load_patterns.md) for more info.

#### <ins>Arranger View</ins>
- Added ability to start / restart arrangement playback from the clip pad you're holding in arranger.
  - Note: you need to select a pad of any clip in arranger in order for this to work (it cannot be an empty pad)

#### <ins>Song View</ins>
- Doubled the number of Song View sections from 12 to 24.

#### <ins>Song Grid View</ins>

##### Entering Clips
- Added ability to enter clips in `Song Grid View Green Mode` by `Pressing a Clip Pad` + `Pressing the Clip button` if you have `Select in Green Mode` enabled in the `SETTINGS > DEFAULTS > UI > SONG > GRID` menu.

##### Creating New Clips
- Updated mechanism for creating New Clips in New Tracks in `SONG GRID VIEW` and `SONG ROW VIEW`.
  - The default clip type for new clips created can be configured in `SETTINGS > DEFAULTS > UI > CLIP TYPE > NEW CLIP TYPE` menu.
    - You can also configure whether the clip type for the next clip type you create should default to the last clip type you created. This helps with fast creation of multiple clips of the same type. You can enable this default setting in the `SETTINGS > DEFAULTS > UI > CLIP TYPE > USE LAST CLIP TYPE` menu.
    - NOTE for `SONG ROW VIEW`: The default clip type / last clip type setting cannot be used with CV clips and Audio clips in Song Row View. If you set the default to CV or Audio or enable use of the last clip type (and the last clip type is a CV or Audio Clip), then it will create a Synth clip by default.

#### <ins>Audio Clips</ins>
- Added audio output modes, and changed audio clip monitoring to be seperate from source selection. Monitoring is now on
when the output is a SAMPLER or a LOOPER, chosen by turning the select knob in an audio clip.
- Added the ability to trim from the start of an audio clip without reversing it (enable in Community Features menu).

#### <ins>Instrument Clip View</ins>

##### Pad Rendering
- Note velocity is now displayed in clips using colour intensities. The note head (the bright part)
now stands out from the tail in proportion to its velocity. At velocity 127 it is identical to official,
at velocity 0 it would look the same as its tail (but you can't have 0 velocity).

##### Scale Mode
- If scale mode is active, you can now check the current root note and scale by long pressing the scale button. On 7SEG it will display the root note on press and scale on release.
- Long pressing the scale button will not result in entering or exiting scale mode so you can safely check the current root note and scale without accidentally exiting scale mode.

##### Randomizer submenu
- Added a new submenu to the `Sound` menu called `Randomizer`. This menu gives you access to the following parameters (which affect both sequenced and arpeggiated notes):
  - `Lock`: This parameter determines whether the randomized values will be locked to fixed values. If you change any of the randomizer parameters, the sequence of randomized values will change to a new one and will be locked again.
  - `Velocity Spread`: This parameters lets you apply some random variation to the notes.
  - `Note probability`: This parameter determines the likelihood of a note being played or not (this is in addition to the Note/Row probability).
  - `Reverse Probability`: This parameter determines the likelihood of a note's sample of being reversed.

##### Note / Note Row Probability, Iterance, Fill
- Enhanced existing note probability, iteration and fill function functionality by enabling you to use each type independently. This means that you can now apply probability to iteration and fill and you can also apply iteration to fill.
  - To edit probability, hold a note / audition pad and turn the select encoder to the left to display current probability value / set new probability value.
  - To edit iterance, hold a note / audition pad and turn the select encoder to the right to display current iterance value / set new iterance value.
  - To edit fill, you need to access the new note and note row editor menu's.
- Added new note and note row editor menu's to edit note and note row parameters.
  - Hold a note and press the select encoder to enter the note editor menu. While in the note editor menu, the selected note will blink. You can select other notes by pressing the notes on the grid.
  - Hold a note row audition pad and press the select encoder to enter the note row editor menu. While in the note row editor menu, the selected note row's audition pad will blink. You can select other note row's by pressing the note row audition pad or by scrolling with the vertical encoder.
  - The iteration is now also customizable with custom iteration steps. If you scroll the iteration parameter all the way to the right, you will see the `CUSTOM` option. If you click the `SELECT` encoder, a new menu will appear to select the `DIVISOR` parameter (you can select from 1 to 8), and also as many `ITERATION #` toggles as `DIVISOR` is set, to allow you to activate or deactivate each iteration step.

##### Recording
- Enabled seamless linear recording of drone notes using audition pads or external midi.
  - When linear recording to a clip, you can seamlessly record a drone note using the audition pads or from external midi by continuing to audition / send a note until the linear recording stops. After linear recording stops, you can stop auditioning / send a note off and the drone note will persist without any breaks or re-triggering.

##### Synth/Kit Clips
- Added Auto-Load feature to sample browser, so you can load the sounds to the instrument as you preview them. Auto-Load can be engaged while in sample browser, if you press the `Load` button.
- Sounds have now the ability to send MIDI notes at the same time as they play a sample. This will allow your synths and drums to trigger external devices. A new menu `MIDI` has been added at the bottom of the `SOUND` menu to set the MIDI channel and the note (in case of drum sounds).

##### CV Clips
- Added the ability to set a CV instrument to use both 1 and 2 channels, which makes the cv2 source selectable between mod wheel, velocity, and aftertouch
  - Turn `SELECT` to choose `1 AND 2 (BOTH)` CV / Gate channel.
  - Press `SELECT` to enter the `CV Instrument Menu`
  - Enter the  `CV 2 Source (CV2)` submenu
  - Select from `OFF, Y, Aftertouch, Velocity`
- CV clips can now be named like other clips.

##### MIDI Clips
- Added ability to rename MIDI CC's in MIDI clips. Changes are saved by Instrument (e.g. per MIDI channel). Changes can be saved to a `MIDI preset`, with the `Song`, or to a `MIDI device definition file`. See documentation on [MIDI Device Definition Files](docs/features/midi_device_definition_files.md) for more info.
- Added MIDI CC numbers and labels to `Gold (Mod) Encoder` popups.

#### <ins>Automation View</ins>

##### Parameters
- Added Vibrato and Sidechain patch cables to Automation View Overview and Grid Shortcuts
- Added ability to automate all Monophonic (Channel) Expression parameters (X - Pitch Bend, Y - Mod Wheel, Z - Channel Pressure / Aftertouch) in Synth / Kit Row (with Affect Entire Off) / MIDI / CV

##### Copy/Paste
- Added same shortcut that is used for copy / pasting notes in Instrument Clip View to Automation View to copy / paste automation. While in the Automation Editor, Copy with `Learn + <>`. Paste with `Shift + Learn + <>`.

#### <ins>Keyboard View</ins>

##### Kits
- Added ability to change the pad size in the `KIT VELOCITY KEYBOARD VIEW` using the Zoom In/Out shortcut by `Pressing + Turning <>`
- Midi and Gate kit rows now are arpeggiator-enabled, and they have each a menu to set it up.
- `KIT VELOCITY KEYBOARD VIEW` Changes:
  - Additional shortcut of `Pressing + Turning <>` to change the pad size using the Zoom In/Out.
  - Went from 8 zoom levels to 13, with mostly smaller jumps in size and number of drum pads between levels.
  - Rectangular pads of various sizes are used where needed to fully cover the screen without any partial pads. This means you can now have six or four pads, or even the entire screen as a single pad.
  - Zoom level 1 pads play the system-level default velocity (64 by default out of a maximum 127, but it is user defineable), and levels 2 and 3 have a slightly lowered max velocity of 100 to make them more useable.
  - Pad colors are calculated to avoid having adjacent pads of the same color as much as possible.
  - Default pad brightness is set to match the default brightness value, so they will be more visible if needed. They will dim when pressed instead of getting brighter. The brightness gradient over the drum pads, going from dim on the low velocity pads to bright on the highest, is now much more apparent, due to the max brightness being higher, the lowest brightness being lower, and using a quadratic curve for the brightness ratio rather than linear. The amount that the drum pads dim when pressed depends on the pad area, so that smaller pad presses will be more visible, and larger pad presses won't be TOO visible, i.e. they won't have a potentially unpleasant strobe light flashing behavior.

##### Layout
- Added the classic piano keyboard layout.

### Sequencer

#### <ins>Arpeggiator</ins>
- Added `NOTE PROBABILITY (PROB)` paramater that will apply a probability to be played or not to notes (after rhythm has been applied).
- Added `CHORD SIMULATOR (CHRD)` paramater to Kit Rows, that will emulate a held chord so you can use `NOTE MODE` on them.
- Added `SPREAD` parameters (Velocity, Gate, and Octave) that will allow you to control how those parameters of each arp step are deviated from its base value. Additionally, a `LOCK` parameter will allow you to lock the generated values to create a repeating pattern. Velocity Spread
also affect normal sequenced notes while arpeggiator is Off.
- Added `BASS PROBABILITY (BASS)` paramater that will allow you to control the chance of a note being replaced the bass (lowest) note of the inputted notes.
- Added `STEP REPEAT (REPE)` paramater (with values 1 to 8) that makes walked notes in the pattern be repeated X times before moving to the next note+octave in the pattern.
- Added `CHORD PROBABILITY (CHRD)` paramater that will allow you to control the chance of a note to play, at the same time, itself and other notes to form a chord (5th, 3rd and 7th).
- Added `CHORD POLYPHONY (POLY)` paramater that works together with the previous parameter, and this one will dictate how big is the chord, that is, how many notes will be played at the same time.
- Added `REVERSE PROBABILITY (RVRS)` paramater that will allow you to control the chance of a sound to invert the `Reverse` setting for that note. This parameter will only affect oscillators whose type is `Sample` (it does not affect wavetables, SCW, or standard waveforms).
- Added `LOCK` parameter to allow you to freeze the current set of randomized values so the sequence has a repeatable pattern.
- Added new `WALK1`, `WALK2`, `WALK3` and `PATTERN` note modes.
- Exposed several parameters from the `Randomizer` also for non-arpeggiated notes: `Velocity Spread`, `Note probability`, and `Reverse Probability`.

### MIDI

#### <ins>Learn</ins>
- Added new `MIDI LEARN` menu to the `SONG` menu. In `Song Grid View` this menu enables you to learn `Clip/Section Launch`. In `Song Row View` this menu enables you to learn the `Clip/Section Launch` and `Instrument`.
  - While in this menu, you just need to `hold a clip / section` and send midi to learn that clip / section. If you press the `clip / section` again you will unlearn it.
- Added ability to `Midi Learn Instruments` and `Select the Audio Source for Audio Clips` in `Song Grid View Green Mode` by moving `Midi Learn Clip/Section Launch` actions to the `MIDI LEARN` menu mentioned above.
- `Midi Learned Note Input for the Whole Kit` now persists between Kit preset changes.
- Fixed unexpected behaviour for `Synth` and `Kit` clips that would cause `MIDI LEARNED PARAMS` to get lost when changing presets for Synth / Kits.
  - Note: for `Kit` clips it will migrate midi learn for `Kit Affect Entire` params only.
- Added new learnable global command `LOAD NEXT SONG`, which when received while playing, it will queue to load the next song within the folder of the current song.

### SD CARD

#### <ins>SETTINGS folder</ins>
- A new folder has been created in the root of the SD card titled `SETTINGS`
- The following files which were previously saved in the root of the SD card have been moved to the `SETTINGS` folder: `MIDIDevices.XML`, `MIDIFollow.XML`, `PerformanceView.XML` and `CommunityFeatures.XML`.
  - Note: if you revert back to an earlier firmware, you will need to move these files back to the root of the SD card so that they can be loaded.

#### <ins>MIDI_DEVICES folder</ins>
- A new folder has been created in the root of the SD card titled `MIDI_DEVICES`
- MIDI device definition files can be saved to / loaded from `MIDI_DEVICES/DEFINITION/`
- See documentation on [MIDI Device Definition Files](docs/features/midi_device_definition_files.md) for more info.

## c1.2.0 Chopin

### Sound Engine

#### <ins>DX7 Synth</ins>
- Added DX7 compatible synth type with support for importing patches from DX7 patch banks in syx format, as well as editing of patch parameters.

#### <ins>Audio Clips</ins>
- Added ability to record from a specific track's output. Set an audio clips input to TRACK, then in the audio clip menu use the TRACK menu to select the specific track to record from
  - To hear the instrument through the audio clip's FX set the input to TRACK (FX)
- Audio clips with monitoring (or TRACK FX) active in grid mode now support in place overdub using the global midi loop/layer commands

#### <ins>Compressors</ins>
- Added blend control to compressors

#### <ins>FM Synth Filters</ins>
- Added filters in FM synth mode. They're set to OFF by default, enable by changing them to any other mode using the menu or db/oct shortcut.

- Fixed bug with Reverb HPF not saving to / loading from the Song

### MIDI

#### <ins>Sysex</ins>
- Added Universal SysEx Identity response, including firmware version.

#### <ins>MPE</ins>
- Allow changing MPE y output to CC1 to support more synths
- Removed MPE zone auto learn as a huge source of midi bugs, MPE must now be configured in the menu

#### <ins>Loopback</ins>
- Removed `MIDI LOOPBACK` feature as it included a number of bugs that could not be easily fixed in the feature's current state. This feature may be re-designed and re-introduced in the future when an implementation can be found that does not introduce bugs.

#### <ins>Takeover</ins>
- Fixed a couple bugs with the `MIDI TAKEOVER` modes `PICKUP` and `SCALE` which did not work properly when recording automation and when editing automated parameters.

#### <ins>Follow</ins>
- Fixed a couple bugs with `MIDI FOLLOW`:
  - You can now edit parameters while step editing (e.g. holding a note)
  - If you enable `MIDI Follow Feedback Automation` the Deluge will now send feedback when step editing

### User Interface

#### <ins>General</ins>
- The maximum zoom level for timelines has been increased. Now, the maximum zoom is the point the point where the entire timeline is represented by a single grid cell.
- Added community feature toggle `Alternative Playback Start Behaviour (STAR)` to change the behaviour of playback start shortcuts as follows:
  - With playback off, pressing `PLAY` will start playback from the current grid scroll position
  - With playback off, pressing `HORIZONTAL ENCODER ◀︎▶︎` + `PLAY` will start playback from the start of the arrangement or clip
- Removed `High CPU Usage Indicator` feature.

#### <ins>Menu UI Improvements</ins>
- For toggle (ON/OFF) menus, you can now view and toggle the ON/OFF status without entering the menu by simply pressing on the `SELECT` encoder while the menu is selected.
  - OLED renders a checkbox that shows current ON/OFF status. Selecting that menu with select encoder will toggle the checkbox as opposed to entering the menu.
  - 7SEG renders a dot at the end of the menu item to show current ON/OFF status. Selecting that menu with select encoder will toggle the dot as opposed to entering the menu.
- Submenus on OLED are rendered with a ">" at the end to indicate that it is a submenu.
- Updated Fonts and Character Spacing on OLED to provide a more refined and polished user experience.
- The note range selection menu (aka "BOTTOM-TO-TOP") is skipped when there is only one range to select.

#### <ins>OLED Display Improvements</ins>
- Updated OLED display for `SONG VIEW` and `ARRANGER VIEW` to display the Song Name, Current Tempo and Current Root Note and Scale Name.
- Updated OLED display to stop scrolling text while playback is running.

#### <ins>Audio Export</ins>
- Added `AUDIO EXPORT`, an automated process for exporting `CLIP's` while in `SONG VIEW` and `TRACK's` while in `ARRANGER VIEW` to individual files. Press `SAVE + RECORD` to start exporting clips/tracks. Press `BACK` to cancel exporting and stop recording and playback.
  - You can also start audio export via a new `EXPORT AUDIO` menu found in the `SONG` menu accessible in Song and Arranger Views. Start the export by entering the `SONG\EXPORT AUDIO\` menu and pressing `SELECT` on the menu item titled `START EXPORT`. It will exit out of the menu and display the export progress on the display.

#### <ins>Recording</ins>
- Enabled toggling of `METRONOME` during `RECORD COUNT-IN`.
- Fixed a bug where instruments and kits wouldn't respect record arming state. They no longer record when not armed

#### <ins>Clip/Section Launching</ins>
- A white playhead is now rendered in Song Grid and Performance Views that let's you know when a clip or section launch event is scheduled to occur. The playhead only renders the last 16 notes before a launch event.
  - Note: this playhead can be turned off in the Community Features submenu titled: `Enable Launch Event Playhead (PLAY)`
- The display now shows the number of Bars (or Quarter Notes for the last bar) remaining until a clip or section launch event in all Song views (Grid, Row, Performance).
- A new option, 'Launch Exclusively', isolates a clip section from all other launch activity. This option is found to the left of option 'Launch non-exclusively' when selecting the section's number of repetitions. As a complement to non-exclusive sections that arm and turn off when another section is launched, exclusive sections remain independant.

#### <ins>Audio Clips</ins>

##### General
- Added ability to select audio source from within an Audio Clip by opening the `Audio Clip Sound Menu` (Press `SELECT`) and Selecting the `AUDIO SOURCE` menu
- Added new `ACTIONS` menu in the `Audio Clip Sound Menu` (Press `SELECT`).

##### Timestretching
- Added new shortcut to set the length of an audio clip to the same length as its sample at the current tempo. This functionally removes timestretching until the Audio Clip length or Song tempo is changed.
  - Press `▼︎▲︎` + `◀︎▶︎` to set the Audio Clip length equal to the length of the audio sample.
    - This action is also available in the `Audio Clip Sound Menu` (Press `SELECT`) by Selecting the `ACTIONS` menu and Pressing `SELECT` on the `Set Clip Length to Sample Length` action.
  - Press `SHIFT` + `◀︎▶︎` + `turn ◀︎▶︎` to adjust the audio clip's length independent of timestretching.

#### <ins>Instrument Clips</ins>

##### General
- Added ability to sync LFO2. Where LFO1 syncs relative to the grid, LFO2 syncs relative to individual notes.
- Added ability to set `CLIP NAMES`. MIDI, SYNTH and KIT clips can now be named. When in a the clip view, press `SHIFT` + `NAME` and enter the name of the clip. For KIT, its important to activate `AFFECT ENTIRE` to name the KIT clip. When on ARRANGER view with an OLED display, you are now able to scroll through the clip names when holding a clip pad and turning `SELECT` encoder.
- Fixed a bug where pressing `UNDO` in a `KIT` could cause the `SELECTED DRUM` to change but not update the `GOLD KNOBS` so that they now control that updated kit row.
- Fixed a bug where you could not turn `RECORDING OFF` while auditioning a note in an `INSTRUMENT CLIP`. With this fix you can now record drone notes when using `LINEAR RECORDING`.

##### Velocity View
- Added `VELOCITY VIEW`, accessible from `AUTOMATION VIEW OVERVIEW` by pressing the `VELOCITY` shortcut, from `AUTOMATION VIEW EDITOR` by pressing `SHIFT OR AUDITION PAD + VELOCITY` or from `INSTRUMENT CLIP VIEW` by pressing `AUDITION PAD + VELOCITY`.
  - Velocity View enables you to edit the velocities and other parameters of notes in a single note row using a similar interface to `AUTOMATION VIEW`.

##### Scales
- Added learning a user specified scale.
  - Hold `LEARN` and press `SCALE` while in clip view. Notes from current clip & all scale mode clips are learned as the "USER" scale. This scale is part of the normal scale rotation, accessible with `SHIFT + SCALE`, and saved as part of the song. If another user scale is learned, the previous one is overwritten: currently each song can only have one user scale.
  - If you enter scale mode from a chromatic clip, and the implied scale cannot be represented by any of the existing preset scales, it will be learned as a user scale, overwriting the previous USER scale.
- Added `ACTIVE SCALES` menu.
  - `SONG > ACTIVE SCALES` toggles scales on and off from the `SHIFT + SCALE` rotation for the current song. Active scales are saved as part of the song. On 7-segment display dot indicates that the named scale is active, lack of dot indicates it has been disabled.
  - `DEFAULTS > SCALE > ACTIVE SCALES` sets the active scales for new songs. When `RANDOM` is set as `DEFAULTS > SCALE > INIT SCALE`, the random scale is selected from default active scales.

#### <ins>Song View</ins>

##### Song Macros
- Added ability to create song macros to quickly switch playing clips from inside clip view without needing to go into song view.
- From song view, open the `SONG MENU` and enter the `CONFIGURE MACROS` menu to edit macros

##### Clip Settings Menu
- Holding a clip in `SONG GRID VIEW` or the status pad for a clip in `SONG ROW VIEW` and pressing `SELECT` brings up a `CLIP SETTINGS` menu.
- If you open the menu with with an `INSTRUMENT CLIP` selected, then the menu will give you three options:
  1) `Convert to Audio`: Press select on this option to convert the selected `instrument clip` into an `audio clip`. The menu will exit after converting the clip.
    - Note: for `SONG ROW VIEW`, you can still convert an empty instrument clip to an audio clip the regular way by holding a pad for that clip in the main grid and pressing select.
  2) `Clip Mode`: Press select on this option to enter the `Clip Mode` menu so you can change the Clip Mode between `INFINITE`, `FILL` and `ONCE`.
  3) `Clip Name`: Press select on this option to enter the `Clip Name` UI to set the name for the clip.
- If you open the menu with an `AUDIO CLIP` selected, then the menu will give two options: `Clip Mode` and `Clip Name`.

#### <ins>Song Grid View</ins>

##### Creating New Clips
- Added new mechanism for creating New Clips in New Tracks in `SONG GRID VIEW`.
  - When you press a pad in a new track, a menu will appear asking you to confirm the type of clip you wish to create. The clip type selected to be created is shown on the display and is also indicated by the clip type button that is blinking.
    - The default clip type for new clips created can be configured in `SETTINGS > DEFAULTS > UI > CLIP TYPE > NEW CLIP TYPE` menu.
    - You can also configure whether the clip type for the next clip type you create should default to the last clip type you created. This helps with fast creation of multiple clips of the same type. You can enable this default setting in the `SETTINGS > DEFAULTS > UI > CLIP TYPE > USE LAST CLIP TYPE` menu.
    - If you just a tap a pad quickly to create a new clip, it will create that new clip using either the default clip type or the last clip type you created (if you enable this).
    - If you press and hold a pad, you can choose a different type to create in a number of ways:
      - by turning the select encoder to switch between the various clip types. You can create that clip type by pressing on the select encoder or letting go of the pad.
      - by pressing one of the clip type buttons (e.g. `SYNTH`, `KIT`, `MIDI`, `CV`).
      - If you let go of the pad without selecting a different type, it will create the clip using the last create type (or the last selected type if you changed selection using select encoder).
    - If you press `BACK` before releasing a pad or selecting a clip type, it will cancel the clip creation.
    - These changes only apply to `SONG GRID VIEW` and NOT `SONG ROW VIEW`

##### Converting Empty Instrument Clips to Audio Clips
- To convert an empty Instrument Clip to an Audio Clip, you will now use the `CLIP SETTINGS` menu described above.

##### Loop and Layering Loop Pads
- Added community feature toggle `Grid View Loop Pads (LOOP)` to illuminate two pads (Red and Magenta) in the `GRID VIEW` sidebar for triggering the `LOOP` (Red) and `LAYERING LOOP` (Magenta) global MIDI commands to make it easier for you to loop in `GRID VIEW` without a MIDI controller.

##### Entering Performance View
- Changed the shortcut to enter Performance View in `SONG GRID VIEW` from the `PINK GRID MODE` to the `KEYBOARD` button for consistency with `SONG ROW VIEW` and `ARRANGER VIEW`.
- Removed `PINK GRID MODE`

#### <ins>Performance View</ins>
- Updated `PERFORMANCE VIEW` UI for exiting out of `EDITING MODE`. While in `EDITING MODE`, you can now press `BACK` to exit out to the previous screen.

#### <ins>Arranger View</ins>

##### General
- Added ability to `AUTOMATE TEMPO` in `ARRANGER VIEW` by turning the `TEMPO` encoder while recording. To delete the automated tempo, press `SHIFT` + `TEMPO`.
- Added ability to rename `MIDI TRACKS` in `ARRANGER VIEW`.

##### Playback Start
- Changed the behaviour of the `PLAY` button while in `ARRANGER VIEW` with `CROSS SCREEN AUTO SCROLL MODE` active. Pressing `PLAY` while playback is off will now start playback from the current scroll position.

##### Clip Pad Rendering
- Updated `ARRANGER VIEW` Clip pad rendering. Clip's are now rendered more simply which should also increase Arranger View performance, especially when using cross screen mode. Clip's are now rendered as follows:
   - The `clip head` (the first pad where the clip is placed in the arrangement) is rendered the clip colour brightly.
   - The `clip loop points` (the pad's where the clip, if extended past it's length will loop) are rendered the clip colour but dimly.
   - The `clip tails` (the pad's between the clip head and clip loop points) are rendered the clip's colour but dimly and blurred.

#### <ins>Keyboard View</ins>

##### General
- Added ability to scroll `KEYBOARD VIEW` horizontally using `<>` while editing Param values in the menu.

##### Chord Layouts
- New `CHORDS` keyboard layout. The `CHORD` keyboard provides easy building and playing of in-scale chords. The `CHORD` keyboard provides two modes, a `ROW` mode, inspired by the Launchpad Pro, and a `COLUMN` mode, inspired by some of the features in the OXI one and others.
- New `CHORD LIBRARY` keyboard layout. `CHORD LIBRARY` keyboard is a library of chords split up into columns, where each column belongs to a specific root note. Going up and down the columns will play different chords of the same root note. Voicings can also be changed with pressing a pad and pressing the `◀︎▶︎` encoder and turning it.
- As the UI and implementation is still experimental, a community setting has to be activated to access the `CHORD`  and `CHORD LIBRARY` keyboards.

##### Kits
- Added ability to load a sample to a drum in the `KIT VELOCITY KEYBOARD VIEW` by holding a drum pad and pressing `LOAD` or `KIT`.
- Pressing drum pads in the `KIT VELOCITY KEYBOARD VIEW` will now update the drum selection so that you can edit the parameters of each drum with gold knobs directly from the kit velocity keyboard view when affect entire is disabled.
  - Note: if you use the `MIDI FOLLOW FEEDBACK` feature, no MIDI Feedback data will be sent when you change drum selections in this view because it will send too much MIDI data and affect the Deluge's performance.
- Fixed a bug where you wouldn't enter drum creator to select a drum sample when creating a new kit in the `KIT VELOCITY KEYBOARD VIEW`.

## c1.1.1 Beethoven

### User Interface

- Added `BASS FREQUENCY` and `TREBLE FREQUENCY` parameters to the list of assignable parameters in `PERFORMANCE VIEW`.
- Fixed `PERFORMANCE VIEW` bug where stutter pad could get stuck in active state which should not be possible.
- Fixed a couple bugs around `VU METER` rendering.
- Fixed a `MIDI FOLLOW` bug where the Deluge could crash if sending a note while loading a new song.
- Fixed `KIT CLIP` bug where having a note row without a drum blocked creating a drum in that row
- Fixed `SONG GRID VIEW` bug where `SECTIONS` would playback in the order of `SONG ROW VIEW`
- Fixed an `ARRANGER VIEW` bug where you could not move a `WHITE` clip to `SONG GRID VIEW` without the Deluge freezing.

## c1.1.0 Beethoven

### Sound Engine

#### <ins>General</ins>
- The default `Mod-FX type` for songs is now `DISABLED` rather than `FLANGER`.
- Fixed Stereo Unison Spread + Ringmod Synth Mode + Noise causing excessively loud output.
- Fixed some bugs around the Waveform Loop Lock feature which allowed setting invalid loop points.
- Fixed a bug in triangle LFO that could cause audible artefacts with some modulation targets, particularly when synced.

#### <ins>Reverb</ins>
- Added an adapted version of the reverb found in Émilie Gillet's Mutable Instruments Rings module. Switch between reverb types within the new `MODEL` sub-menu under `SOUND > FX > REVERB`.
    - This `MUTABLE` reverb model has been set as the default reverb model for new songs. Old songs will respect the reverb model used with those songs.

#### <ins>Compressors</ins>
- Added compressors to synths, kits, audio clips, and kit rows. The compressor can be enabled and edited from their respective menus.
- Compressor behavior has been changed to reduce clipping. Songs made with community release 1.0.x may need to have their volume manually adjusted to compensate. This is done via affect entire in song/arranger mode, or by entering the `SONG MENU` by pressing `SELECT` in Song View and navigating to  `MASTER > VOLUME`

#### <ins>Polyphony / Voice Count </ins>
- Added new `Max Voices (VCNT)` menu which lets you configure the Maximum number of Voices for a Polyphonic instrument
- Updated default `Max Voices` for new synth's to `8 voices`. Old synths for which a max number of voices has not been configured will default to `16 voices`.

### User Interface

#### <ins>General</ins>
- Added a feature which saves user-defined pad brightness level and restores it at startup. `SETTINGS>DEFAULTS>PAD BRIGHTNESS`
- **(Removed in 1.2)** Added new `High CPU Usage Indicator`. The `PLAY` button button will blink when deluge CPU usage is high which indicates that synth voices / sample playback may be culled.
  - To activate the feature, press `SHIFT` + `SELECT` : `MENU > DEFAULTS > HIGH CPU INDICATOR`.
- Added new default menu to set the length of time to register a `Hold Press` for use with `Sticky Shift`, `Performance View`, and the `Keyboard Sidebar Layouts.`
  - Set the default Hold Press time by accessing `SETTINGS > DEFAULTS > HOLD PRESS TIME`
- Fixed numerous bugs, including some crash bugs, around the display of `QUANTIZED STUTTER`.
- Fixed a bug with `SHIFT + SCROLL SELECT ENCODER` on small menus which would allow moving off the end of the menu, causing crashes.
- Fixed several bugs with pad grid rendering.

#### <ins>Documentation</ins>
- Created a new menu hierarchies document that documents the Deluge menu structure for OLED and 7SEG and can be used as a reference for navigating the various menu's. See: [Menu Hierarchies](docs/menu_hierarchies.md)

#### <ins>Menu UI Improvements</ins>
- Holding back now fully exits the menu

#### <ins>OLED Display Improvements</ins>
- Added parameter names (including mod matrix / patch cable mappings) to Mod (Gold) Encoder popups.
- `ARRANGER VIEW` and `SONG VIEW` now display the name of the current view on the screen.
- The 12TET note name is now displayed along with the MIDI note number.
- Added a new community setting which allows emulating the 7SEG style on the OLED display. When set to `TOGGLE` press `SHIFT`+`LEARN/INPUT`+`AFFECT ENTIRE` to switch to the emulated 7SEG display.
- Fixed several cases where popups could get stuck open.
- Fixed a number of minor rendering bugs.

#### <ins>Mod (Gold Encoders)</ins>
- Added Mod Button popups to display the current Mod (Gold) Encoder context (e.g. LPF/HPF Mode, Delay Mode and Type, Reverb Room Size, Compressor Mode, ModFX Type and Param).
- Mod (Gold) Encoders learned to the Mod Matrix can now access the full range of the Mod Matrix / Patch Cable parameters (Values from -50 to +50 where previously only 0 to +50 were accesible via Mod (Gold) Encoders).
- Mod (Gold) Encoder LED indicators are now bipolar for bipolar params (e.g. `PAN`, `PITCH`, Patch Cables). Positive values illuminate the top two LEDs. Negative values illuminate the bottom two LEDs. The middle value doesn't light up any LEDs.

#### <ins>Startup Song</ins>
- Added feature to automatically load song projects at startup.
    - To activate the feature, press `SHIFT` + `SELECT`: `MENU > DEFAULTS > STARTUP SONG`.
    - Modes are `NEW SONG`,`TEMPLATE`,`LAST OPENED SONG`,`LAST SAVED SONG`.
    - Failsafe mode introduced using canary file to deactivate feature in case of crash at startup.

#### <ins>Performance View</ins>
- Added `PERFORMANCE VIEW`, accessible in Song View by pressing the Keyboard button. Allows quick control of Song Global FX.

#### <ins>Automation View</ins>
- Added `AUTOMATION VIEW` for Audio Clips and Arranger View.
- Added `AUTOMATION VIEW` for `PATCH CABLES / MODULATION DEPTH`. Simply enter the modulation menu that displays `SOURCE -> DESTINATION` and then press `CLIP` to access the `AUTOMATION VIEW EDITOR` for that specific Patch Cable / Modulation Depth.
  - You can also use the `SELECT ENCODER` while in the `AUTOMATION VIEW EDITOR` to scroll to any patch cables that exist.
- Updated `AUTOMATION VIEW EDITOR` to allow you to edit Bipolar params according to their Bipolar nature. E.g. positive values are shown in the top four pads, negative value in the bottom four pads, and the middle value (0) is shown by not lighting up any pads.
- Updated `AUTOMATION VIEW` for MIDI Clips to load the Parameter to CC mappings from the `MIDI FOLLOW MODE` preset file `SETTINGS/MIDIFollow.XML`. These Parameter to CC mappings are used as the quick access MIDI CC shortcuts dislayed in the Automation Overview and with the shortcut combos (e.g. `SHIFT` + `SHORTCUT PAD`).
- Updated `AUTOMATION VIEW` to move the `INTERPOLATION` shortcut to the `INTERPOLATION` pad in the first column of the Deluge grid (second pad from the top). Toggle interpolation on/off using `SHIFT` + `INTERPOLATION` shortcut pad. The Interpolation shortcut pad will blink to indicate that interpolation is enabled.
- Updated `AUTOMATION VIEW` to move the `PAD SELECTION MODE` shortcut to the `WAVEFORM` pad in the first column of the Deluge grid (very top left pad). Toggle pad selection mode on/off using `SHIFT` + `WAVEFORM` shortcut pad. The Waveform shortcut pad will blink to indicate that pad selection mode is enabled.
- Updated `AUTOMATION VIEW` to provide access to `SETTINGS` menu (`SHIFT` + press `SELECT`)
- Updated `AUTOMATION VIEW` to provide access to the `SOUND` menu (press `SELECT`)
- Updated automatable parameter editing menus (accessed via `SOUND` menu or `SHIFT + PARAMETER SHORTCUT`) to provide the ability to access the `AUTOMATION VIEW EDITOR` directly from the parameter menu. While in the parameter menu press `CLIP` (if you are in a clip) or `SONG` (if you are in arranger) to open the `AUTOMATION VIEW EDITOR` for that respective parameter or patch cable.

#### <ins>Recording</ins>
- Added configuration of the number of `COUNT-IN BARS` from 1 to 4. Found under `SETTINGS > RECORDING > COUNT-IN BARS`.

#### <ins>Song Menu</ins>
- Added a menu for Song-level parameters, accessible in `SONG VIEW` and `ARRANGER VIEW` by pressing `SELECT`.

#### <ins>Song Grid View</ins>
- Streamlined recording new clips in `GRID VIEW` while the Deluge is playing. Short-press empty clip pads in Grid View's `GREEN MODE` while recording is armed to automatically create a new clip and queue it to record at the start of the next bar.
- Fixed a bug preventing clip selection while `SHIFT` was held.

#### <ins>Master Transpose</ins>
- Added Master Chromatic Transpose of All Scale Mode Instrument Clips from any SONG View (`SONG VIEW`, `ARRANGER VIEW`, `ARRANGER AUTOMATION VIEW` and `PERFORMANCE VIEW`). Uses the same shortcut as in a Synth/Midi/CV clip (Press and turn `▼︎▲︎` to transpose all clips by +/- 1 semitone). The number of semitones transposed is customizable (Press `SHIFT` and press and turn `▼︎▲︎`). After transposing, the display shows the new Root Note (and Scale Name on OLED displays).

#### <ins>VU Meter</ins>
- Added a `VU METER` toggle that displays the VU Meter on the sidebar in `SONG`, `ARRANGER`, & `PERFORMANCE VIEW`. To activate it, on a song view ensure `AFFECT-ENTIRE` is enabled, then select the `LEVEL/PAN` mod button and press it again to activate the meter.

#### <ins>Clip Type Conversion</ins>
- Removed ability to convert an Audio Clip to an Instrument Clip (Synth/Kit/MIDI/CV) as this conversion process is currently error/bug prone.
- Restricted changing Synth/MIDI/CV Clips to the Kit Clips and vice versa if the clip is not empty.

#### <ins>Waveform View</ins>
- Added indicators when `WAVEFORM LOOP LOCK` is enabled. 7SEG displays a rightmost `.` on screen and OLED displays a lock icon.
- Modified waveform marker rendering to improve clarity.

#### <ins>Audio Clips</ins>
- The default Mod-FX type is now `DISABLED` rather than `FLANGER` for Audio Clips (this means Mod-FX can be disabled on Audio Clips which was not previously possible).

#### <ins>Instrument Clips</ins>

##### Synth/Midi/CV
- The shortcut `SHIFT` + hold and turn `▼︎▲︎`, inside a clip, has been changed to "Nudge notes vertically" without unexpectedly changing the scale and root note of the whole song.
- Added Synth/MIDI/CV clip configuration of note row play direction. Hold `AUDITION` while entering the `PLAY DIRECTION` menu to set the play direction for the selected note row. While in the note row play direction menu, you can select other note rows to quickly set the play directiom for multiple note rows.

##### Midi
- Added ability to save and load MIDI presets. They end up in a new folder named MIDI.

##### Kits
- Added a `KIT FX MENU` to KITS which allows you to customize the AFFECT ENTIRE KIT parameters with greater control.   Accessible in `KIT CLIP VIEW` by pressing `SELECT` with `AFFECT ENTIRE` enabled.
- Added ability to save a drum kit row back to an synth preset by pressing `AUDITION` + `SAVE`.
- Added a new default setting that controls which playback mode new slices of a kit will receive.
- Drum randomization no longer has a limit on the number of sound files to randomize.
- Pressing `SHIFT` + `RANDOM` now randomizes all non-muted drum kit rows.
- The default Mod-FX type for kit affect-entire is now `DISABLED` rather than `FLANGER`.
- Fixed several crashes related to drum randomization.

#### <ins>Keyboard View</ins>
- Added `SIDEBAR CONTROLS` in  `KEYBOARD VIEW` for synths. By default the two sidebar columns pertain to `VELOCITY` (red) and `MOD WHEEL` (blue). Holding a pad sets it momentarily to that value, tapping a pad latches it to that value. The functionality can be changed per column by holding the top pad and turning `▼▲`. Available options are `VELOCITY`, `MOD WHEEL`, `CHORDS`, `CHORD MEMORY`, and `SCALES`.
- Added retrigger to all keyboard views.
- A new community feature toggle has been added (`Enable KB View Sidebar Menu Exit (EXIT)`) which will enable you to immediately exit the menu using the top left sidebar pad if you are in the `SETTINGS` or `SOUND` menu for `KEYBOARD VIEW`.

### Sequencer

#### <ins>General</ins>
- Fixed numerous crash bugs around parameter automation when entering and leaving clip view.

#### <ins>Presets</ins>
- When changing instrument presets in `SONG VIEW` or `ARRANGER VIEW`, all pertaining clips of that instrument switch as well. Individual clips can still have only their preset changed by doing so in `CLIP VIEW`.

#### <ins>Arpeggiator</ins>
- The arpeggiator has been completely redesigned to have advanced features for the user like independent `OCTAVE MODE` and `NOTE MODE`, `RHYTHM`, `SEQUENCE LENGTH` and `RATCHETS` notes. It also enables MPE keyboards to give more expression to the arpeggiated notes by updating live the velocity of the notes based on Aftertouch or MPE Y data coming from the keyboard.

#### <ins>Scales</ins>
- Added support for 5 and 6 note scales.
- Added 8 new built-in scales: Melodic Minor, Hungarian Minor, Marva (Indian), Arabian, Whole Tone, Blues, Pentatonic Minor, Hirajoshi.

#### <ins>Clip Launch Modes</ins>
- Added `ONCE CLIP` launch mode, which allows a clip to play just once when launched and then mute itself. Settable in Song's `ROWS VIEW` by holding the `MUTE` pad of a row and then pressing `SELECT`.

#### <ins>Note Probability</ins>
- Added `NOT FILL` note probability. Similar to the `FILL` probability but only plays when the `FILL` button is *not* pressed. When the `SYNC-SCALING` button is held, `NOT FILL` notes will be highlighted in red color, as opposed to blue for `FILL` notes.

#### <ins>Note Copy/Paste</ins>
- Added support for copy/paste of single rows.
- Added support for notes to `PASTE GENTLY` which pastes notes without removing old ones.

### MIDI

#### <ins>General</ins>
- Added "MPE collapse" on MIDI clips which converts MPE X/Y/Z to Pitch/Modwheel/Aftertouch CCs for use of MPE controllers with non-MPE aware synths. Configurable via the clip menu.
- Fixed reversal of upstream MIDI ports (port 1 was upstream port 2, port 2 was upstream port 1).
- Fixed a number of MPE channel matching and learning bugs.
- Fixed crash when using an external controller to control ModFX.
- Fixed CC74 on the MPE master channel behaving like an expression event.

#### <ins>Learn</ins>
- Added MIDI learning of `SONG` and `KIT AFFECT ENTIRE` params.
- Added MIDI learn for kits, allowing a whole kit to be learnt to the same midi channel at once. The incoming note is the first row, and increasing notes (chromatically) go to the next rows.
- Added support for learning Program Change methods for most global commands.

#### <ins>Sysex</ins>
- Added support for LUMI Keys SYSEX protocol. When hosting a LUMI Keys keyboard, the Deluge's current scale will automatically be set on the LUMI's keyboard.

#### <ins>Follow</ins>
- Added `MIDI FOLLOW MODE` which causes MIDI data to be directed based on context.
- Added `MIDI FEEDBACK`, so external MIDI controllers can be made aware of the state of the Deluge synth engine. Configurable via the new global `MIDI > MIDI-FOLLOW > FEEDBACK` menu.
- Added Loopy Pro and TouchOsc templates to use with MIDI follow/MIDI feedback.

#### <ins>Takeover</ins>
- Added New MIDI Takeover Mode: `RELATIVE` for use with controllers sending relative value changes

#### <ins>Transpose</ins>
- Added `MIDI control over transpose / scale.`
    - Accessed via external MIDI via a new learnable global MIDI command in `SETTINGS > MIDI > CMD > TRANSPOSE`. It learns the entire channel, not just a single note.
    - Accessed internally from a MIDI clip. Turn the channel to the end of the list past the MPE zones to 'Transpose'.
      Notes in this clip now alter the transposition of the song.
    - Clips not in scale mode are unaffected (similar to the existing transpose behaviour from the encoders).
    - Configureable in `SETTINGS > MIDI > TRANSPOSE` between chromatic and in-scale transposition.

#### <ins>Select Kit Row</ins>
- Added a new global setting, `MIDI > SELECT KIT ROW`, which causes MIDI notes sent to kits to select the corresponding learned row.

### Internal Changes

- The Deluge Build Tool toolchain has been updated from GCC 12 to GCC 13.
- All code is now built in THUMB mode by default, except DSP code which is still ARM.
- Support for parallel toolchains has been added so re-downloading is not required while moving between branches.
- Numerous improvements to the VSCode configuration, including auto-format on save.
- Various types have been renamed and refactored to improve legibility.
- A number of on/off UI toggles have been collapsed in to the new `ToggleBool` class
- `currentSong->currentClip` and similar expressions have been refactored in to functions to improve safety and reduce
  code size.
- String formatting is now done with a compact `printf` implementation in many cases.
- All publicly available fixes to the official firmware are integrated (up to commit
  0501b7dc38a363f89112c1b5c36075f4c0368be9)

## c1.0.1 Amadeus

- Fixed a bug where MIDI learned ModFX parameters in an audio clip with monitoring active could crash
- Fixed various crashes related to parameter automation
- Fixed crash when deleting loop points with loop lock enabled
- USB MIDI upstream ports were accidentally reversed, this is now corrected. If you only see 1 MIDI port on OSX, try
  unplugging the Deluge and then deleting the configuration in "MIDI Audio Setup"
- Fixed potential corruption of MIDI learned settings.

## c1.0.0 Amadeus

### Audio Improvements

##### Effects

- A `MASTER COMPRESSOR` has been added and is accessible in Song View.
- `STEREO CHORUS` has been added to `MOD FX TYPES`. Adjust stereo depth via `MOD FX DEPTH`.
- `GRAIN` has been added to `MOD FX TYPES`. Choose from 5 Grain Presets via `MOD FX FEEDBACK`. †
- `WAVEFOLD` distortion has been added and occurs pre-filter. The parameter pad shortcut is between `SATURATION`
  and `LPF CUTOFF`.
- `UNISON STEREO SPREAD` has been added and can be dialed to spread the unison parts across the stereo field.
  Click `SELECT` when in `UNISON AMOUNT` to reveal the parameter.

##### Filter

- New LPF/HPF State Variable Filters: `SVF NOTCH` and `SVF BANDPASS`.
- New Filter Parameters: `LPF MORPH` and `HPF MORPH`. This morphs the SVF through Lowpass, Bandpass, and Highpass; adds
  drive to the low pass ladder filters, and adds filter fm to the hpf ladder.
- `FILTER ROUTING` is accessible via the Sound Editor menu and adjusts the filter order from `HPF to LPF`, `LPF to HPF`,
  or `PARALLEL`.

##### LFO & Sync

- New LFO Shapes: `RANDOM WALK` and `SAMPLE & HOLD`.
- New Sync Modes: `TRIPLETS` and `DOTTED`. (All previous sync rates now include 'TPLTS' and 'DTTED' options.)

### Sequencing Improvements

`AUTOMATION VIEW` allows you to visually create and edit parameter automations across the main grid pads for SYNTH, KIT,
and MIDI clips on a per step basis at any zoom level. (Excludes MPE automations).

##### Probability & Iteration

- `PROBABILITY BY ROW` allows you to set probability for all notes in a given row, expanding from just being able to set
  probability to currently pressed down notes.
- `QUANTIZE` and `HUMANIZE` notes after they've been recorded/sequenced on either a per row basis or for all notes in a
  given clip at once. *
- Sequenced notes can be set to `FILL` which will only play them when the designated `FILL` button is being held (either
  a Global MIDI Command or `SYNC-SCALING†`)

### Keyboard View Improvements

- New `DRUM KEYBOARD VIEW` added. Kit rows can now be visualized and played across the main grid pads. By default the
  area of each sample is spread across 4x4 pads and additionally provides a range of 16 `VELOCITY` levels. This area can
  be adjusted from 1x1 to 8x8 grids.
- New `IN-KEY` keyboard layout. `IN-KEY` will only display notes that are in key of the selected scale across the
  keyboard layout. The original view is named `ISOMORPHIC`. Users can switch freely between the two and choose their
  Default Keyboard Layout in the `DEFAULTS` Menu.
- Adjust `ROOT NOTE` and `SCALE` with new shortcuts, this assists the user when using the `IN-KEY` keyboard layout where
  not every note is visible to set as a `ROOT NOTE`.
- Adjust the offset of `KEYBOARD VIEW` via `ROW STEP` from 1-16. The Deluge's default `ROW STEP` is 5.
- `HIGHLIGHT INCOMING NOTES` will light up incoming MIDI notes across the current `KEYBOARD VIEW` based on their
  velocity. *
- `NORNS LAYOUT` provides compatibility for the Monome Norns using the 'midigrid' script. †

### MIDI Improvements

- Change handling of MPE expression when collapsed to a single MIDI channel. Previously y axis would still be sent as
  CC74 on single midi channels. This changes it to send CC1 instead, allowing for controllable behavior on more non-MPE
  synths. Future work will make a menu to set this per device.
- Added additional MIDI ports which improves usability of MPE-capable devices via USB by sending MPE to one port and
  non-MPE to the other port.
- MIDI Takeover Mode - Affects how the Deluge handles MIDI input for learned CC controls. Options
  include `JUMP`, `PICKUP`, `SCALE`.
- Fixed bugs in mpe handling so that mpe and MIDI channels can be separated without requiring differentiate inputs

### User Interface Improvements

- `GRID VIEW` is an alternate `SONG VIEW` layout similar to Ableton's 'Session View'. It displays unique clips across
  pad rows and the clip variations across pad columns. Effectively allows you to view and launch 128 clips and
  variations without the need of scrolling to reveal more clips in comparison to `ROW VIEW`'s 8 clips at a time.
- Manual Slicing aka 'Lazy Chopping' is now possible by pressing the `◀︎▶︎` encoder when in the Slice Menu. Allows you
  to create slice points live while listening to the sample playback.
- Any synth preset can now be loaded into a Kit row. Hold the audition pad and press `SYNTH` to browse/load a preset.
- Gold encoders now display a pop-up of their current value when adjusted. The value range displayed is 0-50 for
  non-MIDI parameters and 0-127 for MIDI parameters.
- A `MOD MATRIX` entry has been added to the sound editor menu which shows a list of all currently active modulations of
  a given preset.
- You can change the launch status of a clip from `INFINITE` to `FILL`. When a `FILL` clip is launched it will schedule
  itself to play the fill at such a time that it _finishes_ by the start of the next loop and then mutes itself.
- You can now scroll through parameter values and menus faster by +/- 5 by holding `SHIFT` while turning the `SELECT`
  encoder.
- You can now shift a clip's row color from Song View without having to enter the given clip to do so.
- You can now set the stutter effect to be quantized to `4TH, 8TH, 16TH, 32ND, and 64TH` notes before engaging it. †
- Increased the resolution of modulation between sources and their destinations by including two decimal places to the
  modulation amount. *
- An option to swap the behavior of the `TEMPO` encoder when turned versus pressed & turned. *
- `STICKY SHIFT` - Tapping `SHIFT` will lock `SHIFT` ON unless another button is also pressed during the short press
  duration. Allows for quicker parameter editing. †
- Incoming `MODULATION WHEEL` MIDI data from non-MPE synths now maps to `Y` on the Deluge.
- The metronome's volume now respects the song's volume and will increase or decrease in volume in tandem with
  the `LEVEL`-assigned gold encoder. In addition, a `DEFAULTS` menu entry `METRONOME` enables you to set a value between
  1 and 5 to further adjust the volume of the Metronome.
- An alternative setting when pressing `DELAY`-assigned gold encoders can be enabled. The default
  is `PINGPONG` (`ON/OFF`) and `TYPE` (`DIGITAL/ANALOG`) for the upper and lower gold knobs respectively. The alternate
  mode changes it to  `SYNC TYPE` (`EVEN, TRIPLETS, DOTTED`) and `SYNC RATE` (`OFF, WHOLE, 2ND, 4TH, ETC.`)
  respectively. †
- The default behavior of 'catching'/playing notes when instantly launching/muting clips can now be turned off. This can
  result in less unexpected percussive sounds triggering when instantly switching between clips. *
- Waveform Loop Lock - When a sample has loop start and loop end points set, holding down loop start and tapping loop
  end will lock the loop points together when adjusting their position across the waveform.
- Pressing `AUDITION` + `RANDOM` on a drum kit row will load a random sample from the same folder as the current
  sample. *
- You can now batch delete kit rows which do not contain any notes, freeing kits from unused sounds. *
- Audio waveforms can be shifted in an Audio clip, similar to instrument clips, with the exclusion of wrapping the audio
  around.
- Support for sending and receiving large `SYSEX` messages has been added. This allows 7SEG behavior to be emulated on
  OLED hardware and vice versa. Also allows for loading firmware over USB. As this could be a security risk, it must be
  enabled in community feature settings. †

## Footnotes

`*` - Denotes a feature that is `ENABLED` by default in the `COMMUNITY FEATURES` menu but can be disabled.
